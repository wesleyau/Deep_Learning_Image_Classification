1. Move *.npz archives that contain 5 .npy to own folder using unix
mv *.npz ../npz_folder

2. Seperate the TX and TY Machines, put them in their own folder using unix
mv TX* ./TX
mv TY* ./TY

3. Run split_npy_by_class-final.py for each of the TX and TY Machines

4. Run pny_pixel_stats_final.py for each of the 5 classes for both machines to see what you should normalize the pixel intensities to.

5. Write down the numbers for each and write down the vmin and vmax values you will have to enter into the mask_image scripts for the TX and TY dataet.

5. Run mask_image_final.py on the main directory of the split image classes to mask images and standardize them for input into deep learning model

6. run PCA_vim_vmax.py and K-S test.py on both raw and masked .npy files to see if they can be combined (probably not though)
